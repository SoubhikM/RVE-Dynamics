### Resonance vibrational excitation (**RVE**) dynamics on complex potential energy surfaces.
> Case in hand: **$(^2\Pi_g)$** shape resonance of $N_2^-$

> RVE process looks like following when an incoming $e^-$ hits a neutral $N_2$ molecule and the resonance state is formed which subsequently decays with time and collapses to a vibrational channel $v_f$ of the neutral $N_2$

### $N_2(v_i=0)+e^-(E_{in}) \rightarrow N_2^-(^2\Pi_g)\rightarrow N_2(v_f)+e^-(E_{out})$

> Energetically the RVE process looks like following

### $E_{in}\left(\frac{\hbar^2k_i^2}{2m_e}\right)+E_{N_2 (v_i=0)}=E_{out}\left(\frac{\hbar^2k_f^2}{2m_e}\right)+E_{N_2 (v_f)}=E$

>> Where $v_i$ and $v_f$ are entry and exit channels respectively. $k_i$ and $k_f$ are incoming and outgoing momentum. The energy conservation works as above, mainataing a total energy of E.

> The cross-section spectrum is calculated from T-matrix defined as a Fourier transformed cross correlation function.

### $\hat{T}_{v_f\leftarrow v_i}(E)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{i\frac{Et}{\hbar}}\left \langle \phi_{v_f}| e^{-i\frac{\hat{H}t}{\hbar}}|\phi_{v_i}\right \rangle dE$

>> The cross-section spectrum $\sigma(E)$ subsequently is evaluated as follwoing

### $\sigma_{v_f \leftarrow v_i}(E) = \frac{8\pi^3}{k_i^2} \left | \hat{T}_{v_f\leftarrow v_i}(E)\right|^2$
